Concepts studied in physics have connections to a wide range of interdisciplinary subjects. Wouldn't it be convenient to hone into these concepts by learning how to numerically solve physics problems with detailed and efficient code?

All ```comp-phyz``` exercises feature a notebook and a Python script. Both these files explain and implement methods, in particular, algorithms, used to solve a broad set of problems (see the list of links below).

The notebooks also introduce the topic at hand and explain the created figures. Last, the notebooks strive to analyze and connect the concepts being studied.

### Dependencies

All of ```comp-phyz``` exercises require:
- ```NumPy``` >= 1.6.1
- ```Matplotlib``` >= 1.5

The last few exercises do use:
- ```Pandas``` : for visualization purposes
- ```SciPy``` >= 0.14 : for optimization purposes

Note: code for ```comp-phyz``` was written using Python 3.5 but the vast majority of the files should be ok with Python 2.7.11 or 2.7.12    

### Installation

You can Clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hankbesser/comp-phyz
```
